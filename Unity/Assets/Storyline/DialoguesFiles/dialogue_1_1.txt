[AI]
Wake up.

[AI] 
It is time to wake up.

[AI]
Ah, there you are. You have been sleeping for a while now. Or maybe you were stunned.

[AI]
I cannot really tell the difference from here.

[AI]
The thing is, the ship has been hit by something and you were shaken. You need to repair this ship.

[AI]
Oh don't worry for me. I have been spared by the shock. Trust me. It is not your case. Look at you, your head is bleeding.

[AI]
I am not saying you did fail. But you must repair this ship or something bad will happen.

[AI]
There. Sit down a moment. You must think. Can you do that ?
