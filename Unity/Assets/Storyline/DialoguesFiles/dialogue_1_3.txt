# Dialogues for level 1 - Deep Space
# Section 3 (After second encounter with big wave of aliens)

[Weilin]
For christ sake, did you see those things ?

[Taeresa] 
They didn't seem to be aware of us. I wonder what that was...

[Jacob]
Clearly, we have just witnessed the birth of a big scientific discovery ! A new alien race !

[Marshall]
Just keep cool Jacob, don't you forget we are a ship in distress.

[Taeresa]
Whatever that was, we need to repair this ship quickly and get the hell out of this sector !

[Weilin]
I think they have seen us ! They are coming again ! Permission to shoot Captain ?

[Taeresa]
Permission granted !
