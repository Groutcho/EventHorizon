[Weilin]
For christ sake, did you see those things ?

[Taeresa] 
They didn't seem to be aware of us. I wonder what that was...

[Jacob]
Clearly, we have just witnessed the birth of a big scientific discovery ! A new alien race !

[Marshall]
Just keep cool Jacob, don't you forget we are a ship in distress.

[Taeresa]
Whatever that was, we need to repair this ship quickly and get the hell out of this sector !
