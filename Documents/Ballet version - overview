The player drives a spaceship from above and must destroy hordes of enemy ships that come from every part of screen, in a ballet fashion. The game is backed with classical score, such as waltzs, symphonies and concertos, and praises from a virtual audience, when the player acts in a graceful and elegant way.

The player earns points by :
- destroying enemy ships, with bonus when destroying several ships in a row,
- maintaining a graceful motion, hinted by the ship's trail.

There are three levels of difficulty : Hard, Insane and Japanese. The Japanese level is the hardest and switches the texts to the corresponding language.

The ship is driven by mouse and click.

The player's ship can pick up power-ups in the arena, giving new weapons or abilities.

When the player's ship is destroyed, a message in calligraphy appears : "You are dead." and two choices : "Die Again", "Leave shamefully".

Each level plays a different piece of classical music, whose mood matches the rythm of the ballet of the enemy ships.

To gain access to the next level, the player must earn a minimal score.

When a ship is destroyed, a short and dry "boom" sound plays.
